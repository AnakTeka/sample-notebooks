    "IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to achieve insights. Data scientists can use the best of open source, tap into IBM's unique features, grow their skills, and collaborate with teams. \n",
    "One of the many features of DSX provides the capability to create and train a machine learning model in DSX with little to no coding. This model can subsequently be saved and deployed to Watson Machine Learning on IBM Bluemix and called for scoring in real-time. \n",
    "This tutorial is a continuation of the following logistic regression analysis: \n",
    "https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml-example-log-regress.html \n",
    "which creates, trains, saves and deploys a logistic regression model that predicts the possibility for a tent purchase based on age, sex, marital status and job profession for an individual. However, in this tutorial, a very simple Python Flask Web application front end will be created to call this deployed model in real time. \n",

    "### 1.1 Prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook and the corresponding tutorial sections require several IBM Bluemix services. You must have the following resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An Apache Spark instance\n",
    "- An IBM Watson Machine Learning instance\n",
    "- A Python Flask instance\n",
    "- An Object storage instance\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have these services initiated, you can add them by using your Bluemix dashboard or by opening a project that has them. For more information about setting up these services, see [Setting up your machine learning environment](https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml-setup.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"test2\"></a>\n",
    "### 1.2 Retrieve your credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code samples in this notebook, you must supply information, such as the URL, username, password, and scoring endpoint variables from your environment. The details on how to do this are described in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log into your Bluemix account and, from the dashboard, select the **IBM Watson Machine Learning** service that you created.\n",
    "2. Click **Service credentials**.\n",
    "3. Click **View credentials** and then copy the values from the URL, username, and password fields to the corresponding lines of code in the code cells in this notebook. \n",
    "4. To find the scoring endpoint, from the navigation pane, click **Manage** > **Launch Dashboard**.\n",
    "5. On the **Deployments** tab, from **Actions**, click **View Details**.\n",
    "6. Copy the scoring endpoint and paste it into the corresponding variable in this notebook.\n",

    "<a id=\"test3\"></a>\n",
    "### 1.3 Authenticate and import libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have updated the following code cells with your specific information, you are ready to run the cells. Run the following cell to authenticate yourself to the Watson Machine Learning service and to import necessary libraries."

    "5. In the folder where the unpacked starter code is located, create a file called `MLTutorial.py` and copy the following Python code into that file. As before, update the `url`, `username`, `password`, and `scoring_endpoint` fields to match with your deployed model. You may need to set pasting options to preserve the indentations which are critical for Python code. When completed, save this file.
