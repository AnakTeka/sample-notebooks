    "# Machine learning optimization using the cognitive assistant function\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the cognitive assistant that is part of Jupyter Notebook running a Python kernel. In this sample, you will use cognitive assistant function to optimize machine learning piplelines for a notebook user's dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive assistant currently employs ApacheÂ® Spark (PySpark) and SKLearn (Python scikit-learn) analytics on Spark 2.1 and Python 2, optionally with feature selection, for classification and regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook remains interactive during the optimizations. The execution counter and the kernel activity indicator reflect the activity of both the notebook user and the cognitive assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has the following main sections:\n",
    "1. [Download the data](#download)\n",
    "1. [Format the data](#format)\n",
    "1. [Run the cognitive assistant optimization](#cads)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"download\"></a>\n",
    "## 1. Download the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Because cognitive assistant is especially suited to large data sets, in the following step, you'll be retrieving a large (2.6 GB) .csv file that contains data on HIGGS boson particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the description of the data set on the UCI Web site: \"The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first 21 features (columns 2-22) are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last seven features are functions of the first 21 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. Benchmark results using Bayesian Decision Trees from a standard physics package and 5-layer neural networks are presented in the original paper. The last 500,000 examples are used as a test set.\""
